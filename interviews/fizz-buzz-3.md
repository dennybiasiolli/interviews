# FizzBuzz advanced functional

Create a function with `x`, `y`, `min` and `max` parameters.
The function, for each number between `min` and `max`, should return a list
of strings in the following way:

- "Fizz" when a number is divisible by `x` or contains `x`

- "Buzz" when a number is divisible by `y` or contains `y`

- "Fizz Buzz" when both the `x` and `y` conditions
