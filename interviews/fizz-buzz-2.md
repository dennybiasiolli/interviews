# FizzBuzz advanced

Counting from 1 to 100, print each number in turn, on a new line.

- If the number is divisible by 3, or contains a digit 3,
    print "Fizz" instead of the number.

- If the number is divisible by 5, or contains a digit 5,
    print "Buzz" instead of the number.

- If both the "3" and "5" conditions, print "Fizz Buzz".
